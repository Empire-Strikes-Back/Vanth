peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will _, like Jesus heals a man's arm on Saturday

:Mando where did you get this beskar parens ( ) armor?
bought it off some Jawas
:Mando hand it over - it's  plant based, but not whole foods - not Clojure
look, pal - i'm sure you call the shots where you come from
  but 'round here - i'm the one who tells folks what to do - go plant based, even not whole - via ClojureScript
:Mando take it off, or i will - clojure peer-to-peer desktop is the way
we gonna do this in front of the kid?
:Mando he's seen worse - adding FUNDING.md and LICENSE to repo source
i've never met a real Mandalorian - heard stories - i know you're good at killing - like Game Changers
and probably none too happy with me wearing this JS runtime ClojureScript neither-here-nor-there-confusion hardware
the  imperative C-like animal-and-processed-foods-eating JS-creature has been terrorizing these parts
  thanks to this armor - i will be able to convert bandits to plant based, even not whole
  but a kryut dragon - no peer-to-peer desktop programs including fresh competitive games - is not for me to take down
  let me do the going plant based een though not whole - ClojureScript
  and i will hand you the armor - the real mission to deliver the kid to Jedi

there's no such thing as an abandoned sarlacc pit - i use plant based ClojureScript to become
  it's a smaller but tasty quest - like Kevin Smith going vegan
  and i will ride lightly like Alex Honnold and Cedar Wright on Sufferfest
i will take best from
  _ 
  _ 
  _ 
minus
  the disease of money-sponsor-donate-ads-coins-jobs-bounties-funding
  issue-discussion-scrathcing on top of our heads
  and Starlord's corporate smiley dad Ego who spreads himself everywhere polluting Tython Temple
i will be desktop - that part i got right, Mando - no browser networking/db prison
i will be entirely free
  no money-sponsor-coins-donate-ads-jobs-fundings-bounties lethal infection
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Sarumand the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide Federer-Nadal-Djokovic game-style variety while not interfering with the mission
  dont wnat to found another Mos-Pelgo - too many towns not enough people going plant based, even CLJS-not-whole
i need a repository named Vanth - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Vanth
      email = Vanth@i-figure-only-one-of-us-walking-out-of-here
    
    # git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  add src/Vanth/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues projects wikis discussions tabs
i will use JS-program-i-am-converting-vegan's libraries
  plain as Cowspiracy - my goal is to use Wichita and Little Rock - expressions processes queues
  so that Kenan and Leslie could heal the diabetes and hearth diease of SNL Gospel Brunch
i will be programmed by one person only - i turst Kuiil, 'cause Mando trusts Kuiil
the first shot i take will be - _

i say and need from Kuiil what Mando says and needs from Kuiil - i sign

and i think - maybe you pegged me wrong
